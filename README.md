# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
During my *Data Science Nanodegree* at [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com), I comleted the following projects.


## Project 01: Finding donors
**Abstract:**  The goal of the 'Finding donors' project is to identify potential donors for a fictious charity organization based on their social and professional features. Therefore, multiple supvervised machine learning algorithms were trained, tested, and compared to each other. The hyper-parameters of the most promising algorithm (Random Forest) were further optimized to improve prediction accuracy and F-score. Finally, the most relevant features were analyzed to create insights insights into the identification of potential donors.

**Keywords:** supervised learning, classification, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, parameter tuning

## Project 02: Image classifier
**Abstract:**  In the 'Image classifier' project, a deep neural network was build and trained to identify 102 different flower species from images. The neural network consisted of a pre-trained convolutional network (VGG16) and a fully connected classifier with a single hidden layer. After training over 5 epochs, the network reached an accuracy of more than 70%. Finally, two functions, `train.py` and `predict.py` were implemented deploy the model, e.g., to the command line or to an online application.

**Keywords:** deep learning, neural networks, image classification, PyTorch

## Project 03: Identifying customer segments
**Abstract:** In the 'Identifying customer segments' project, demographic data of individuals living in Germany and customer data of a mail-based sales company were clustered and compared to identify potential customer segments for the sales company. The data was provided by Arvato, a Bertelsmann division. Prior to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering with k-Means, the data was analyzed in detail. Missing values were dropped from the dataset and new features were engineered from existing mixed-type, multi-categorical features. The comparison of the share of the identified clusters in the demographic and the customer dataset reveiled eldery, traditionally-minded persons as promising potential customers for the sales company.

**Keywords:** unsupervised learning, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering, k-Means, data wrangling, feature engineering
