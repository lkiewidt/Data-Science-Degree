# Data Science Portfolio

### Introduction
During my *Data Science Nanodegree* at [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com), I comleted the following projects.


### Project 01: Finding donors
**Abstract:**  The goal of the 'Finding donors' project is to identify potential donors for a fictious charity organization based on their social and professional features. Therefore, multiple supvervised machine learning algorithms were trained, tested, and compared to each other. The hyper-parameters of the most promising algorithm (Random Forest) were further optimized to improve prediction accuracy and F-score. Finally, the most relevant features were analyzed to create insights insights into the identification of potential donors.

**Keywords:** supervised learning, classification, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, parameter tuning
